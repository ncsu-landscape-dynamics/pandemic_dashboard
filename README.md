## Running the Application 

### Available Scripts
Once the repository is cloned or downloaded to local machine, in the project directory, you can run:


`
npm start
` 
* Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
* Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
* The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
* You will also see any lint errors in the console.

`npm test`

* Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.<br />

`npm run build`

* Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
* It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
